        "After 40 minutes, check the temperature of the birds by inserting a thermometer between the leg and the thigh. The temperature should read approximately 68C/155F. (The chicken will continue to cook as it sits, reaching a temperature of about 73C/165\u00b0F.)",

Cook in batches of 3 or 4 pieces at a  time, cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until brown and crisp. Allowing the oil to return to the right temperature between batches will help ensure your chicken is light and crisp.",
        "Take the cooked chicken out of the pan with clean tongs (not the tongs that have been used for raw chicken). Put on a baking tray lined with kitchen roll to help soak up any excess oil. Scoop out any stray pieces of batter from the oil with a slotted spoon.",
        "Transfer the fried chicken to a rack and put on a baking tray. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes, or until cooked through.",

        "Mix the flour, cornflour, baking powder, sugar and a good pinch of fine salt in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Whisk the egg with the milk and melted butter in a jug with a metal whisk until smooth. Gradually whisk the milk and egg mixture into the flour until just combined. Pour into the jug and leave to stand for 10 minutes.",
        "Pour just enough of the batter into the waffle maker to fill each plate and quickly smooth the surface with a palatte knife or spatula. Close the lid and cook the waffles for 4-5 minutes, or until well risen, crisp and brown. Lift carefully out of the waffle maker with tongs and keep warm while the remaining waffles are cooked.",

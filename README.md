Recipe App
==========
App that allows you to search for recipes by their ingredients. The idea behind the app came from all the times I've searched my cupboards and found a variety of ingredients but have no idea how to combine them into something tasty. The recipes were downloading using a python script (see: https://github.com/josh-newton/recipe-scraper). As with all side projects it eventually got dropped but you can see where I got to here: https://josh-newton.github.io/recipe-app.
